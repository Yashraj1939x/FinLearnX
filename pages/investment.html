  <h1>📈 Investment</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    An investment is an asset or property acquired to generate income or gain
    appreciation. Appreciation is the increase in the value of an asset over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Investment requires the outlay of a resource today, such as time, effort, or money,
    for a greater payoff in the future or for generating a profit.
  </p>

    <h2>Where to Invest</h2>

    <h3>Stocks or Equities</h3>
    <p>
      A share of stock represents ownership in a public or private company. Investors
      may receive dividends generated from the company’s net profit. The stock’s value
      can also grow and be sold for capital gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two primary types of stocks are <b>common</b> and <b>preferred</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Bonds or Fixed-Income Securities</h3>
    <p>
      Bonds are investments that require an upfront investment and pay recurring
      interest over time, called coupon payments. At maturity, the investor receives
      the capital invested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonds are a way for governments and companies to raise money.
    </p>

    <h3>Index Funds or Mutual Funds</h3>
    <p>
      Index funds and mutual funds combine multiple investments into a single vehicle.
      Investors can buy shares of one fund that owns shares of many companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutual funds are actively managed, while index funds are usually passively
      managed and aim to mirror a benchmark.
    </p>

    <h3>Real Estate</h3>
    <p>
      Real estate investments involve physical, tangible properties such as land,
      residential homes, office buildings, or warehouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      These investments may include acquiring land, developing properties, or
      purchasing ready-to-occupy sites.
    </p>

    <h3>Commodities</h3>
    <p>
      Commodities are raw materials such as agriculture products, energy resources,
      or metals. Investors may own physical commodities like gold or invest through
      instruments such as ETFs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oil and gas are common examples of commodities.
    </p>

    <h3>Cryptocurrency</h3>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrency is a blockchain-based digital currency used to transact or store
      value. Developers or companies issue coins or tokens that may increase in value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrencies can also be staked, where investors lock tokens to support
      network operations and earn rewards.
    </p>

    <h3>Collectibles</h3>
    <p>
      Collectibles include rare items such as sports memorabilia, comic books, and
      antiques. These items are purchased with the expectation that their value and
      demand will increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proper physical preservation is essential, especially since older items often
      carry higher value.
