  <h1>💰 Budget</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    A budget is an estimation of revenue, expenses, or changes in finances over a
    specified future period and is usually compiled and re-evaluated on a periodic basis.

    that is re-evaluated on a periodic basis.

    <h2>Types of Budget</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>Balanced Budget</li>
      <li>Deficit Budget</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Static vs Flexible Budgets</h2>
    <p>
      There are two major types of budgets: static budgets and flexible budgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A static budget remains unchanged over the life of the budget. Regardless of
      changes that occur during the budgeting period, all accounts and figures
      originally calculated remain the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flexible budget has a relational value to certain variables. The dollar amounts
      listed on a flexible budget change based on sales levels, production levels, or
      other external economic factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both types of budgets are useful for management. A static budget evaluates the
      effectiveness of the original budgeting process, while a flexible budget provides
      deeper insight into business operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, at the start of the year, a company may prepare a static budget based
      on the manufacturing of 100,000 units. As the year progresses, the company may
      want to evaluate the same budget as if it had been prepared for a more realistic
      95,000 units.

    <h2>Personal Budgets</h2>
    <p>
      Individuals and families can have budgets too. Creating and using a budget is
      not just for those who need to closely monitor their cash flows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Budgeting helps manage monthly expenses, prepare for unpredictable events,
      and afford big-ticket items without going into debt.

    <h2>How to Create a Budget</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add up all your income.</li>
      <li>Calculate your expenses.</li>
      <li>Identify debt payments.</li>
      <li>Review your spending.</li>
      <li>Create a spending plan.</li>
      <li>Set financial goals.</li>
      <li>Adjust each month.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once you've created a budget, you may have to do some juggling, especially in
      the first few months. Adjust spending to stay within limits and commit to it.

  <h2>The 50–30–20 Rule</h2>
  <p>
      50% → Needs (food, rent, transport, bills) <br>
      30% → Wants (shopping, entertainment) <br>
      20% → Savings (emergency fund, investments)
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: If monthly income is ₹10,000 → ₹5,000 needs, ₹3,000 wants, ₹2,000 savings
    </p>
