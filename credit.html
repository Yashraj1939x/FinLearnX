  <h1>💳 Credit Score</h1>

  <p class="intro">
    A credit score is a three-digit number that rates an individual's creditworthiness
    and ability to obtain a loan, mortgage, or credit card.
  </p>

  <p>
    A credit score is based on a person's credit history, which includes active accounts,
    total debt levels, and repayment history.

    <h2>How Credit Scores Work</h2>
    <p>
      A credit score can significantly affect your financial life. It plays a key role
      in a lender’s decision to offer credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher scores increase approval chances and lower interest rates, saving money
      long-term.
